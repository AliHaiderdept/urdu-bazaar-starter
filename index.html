           In the dusty pages of time, Lahore rises like an old manuscript written in brick and breath. Founded in an age where caravans stitched continents together, the city learned early the language of empires. From the Ghaznavids’ call to prayer to the measured stride of the Mughals, Lahore became a court of gardens, mosques, and moonlit arches, crowned by the Red Fort and perfumed by Shalimar’s fountains. The Sikh era left its steel and sanctuaries, while the British added clock towers and colleges, folding new ink into the margin of history. Yet through conquest and calm alike, Lahore kept its heartbeat in bazaars and ballads, in poets who turned dust into verse and in streets that remember every footstep. It is a city that does not merely endure time; it converses with it, preserving the past as a living companion to the present.
